/*
TASK 1: Currency symbols (Enum definition)

A currency can be unambiguously identified by its symbol.

Knowing the syntax of enum definition:

enum UserResponse {
  NO = 0,
  YES = 1,
}

define the enum `CurrencySymbol`.

- Available currencies are: USD, EUR, GBP.
- The keys should match the currency symbols.
- The values should hold the currency symbols as strings.

Export the created enum from this file, replacing the empty export below.

export { };
